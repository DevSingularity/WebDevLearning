    <ol>
        First we saw how react runs bts in customreact.js
        <li>Next we went to react app's main.jsx(vite) or index.js(react) and tried to write our own funciton in jsx and
            called
            it and was running perfectly...</li>
        <li>But when we used the reactEle object, it didnt give anything. This happened because react has a function that asks for a specific type of args in it. (Just like any other function)</li>
        <li>So now we created a new object compatible with react's args syntax</li>
        
    </ol>
